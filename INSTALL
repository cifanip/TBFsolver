------------------------------------
How to compile the solver:

- go to directory TBFsolver
- type `make'

------------------------------------
Dependencies: 

Set the dependencies for the following libraries (follow instruction in MakeFile):  

- LAPACK
- FFTW3 (multi-threaded version)
- MUMPS (parallel MPI version)

Please refer to the websites of these libraries to download and link the relevant 
files. 

------------------------------------
Compiler flags:

- POIS_OPT: set to FAST_MODE to compile the fast-Poisson solver; 
            set to MG_MODE to compile the multi-grid Poisson solver.
		    

The optimisation flag is set to -O2 by default. Uncomment debug or extended 
debug flags to activate the debugging mode.
