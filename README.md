# TBFsolver
DNS Turbulent Bubbly Flow solver

TBFsolver is an highly accurate and parallelised solver for the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent bubble-laden channel flow. See [P. Cifani - Highly scalable DNS solver for turbulent bubble-laden channel flow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045793018303311) for more details. 

## COPYING
TBFsolver is distributed under the terms of the General Public License. See the file COPYING for details. 

## INSTALLATION
See file 'INSTALL' for instructions.

## USAGE
TBFsolver is being continuously updated in order to fix possible bugs and add new features. Please, make sure you have downloaded the latest version of the code. An example of a test-case of a minimum turbulent channel flow, loaded with 18 deformable bubbles, is given in folder 'case_18'. Please refer to the [user guide](user_guide/user_guide.pdf) for an illustration of the input parameters.
